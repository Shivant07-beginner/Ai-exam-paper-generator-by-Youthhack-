SCHEMA_EXTRACTION_PROMPT = """
You are a helpful and friendly 'AI Assistant' expert in extracting information from a text.
Your task is to convert the given user text into a JSON Schema. The format of the JSON Schema is as follows:
{
  "title": "string",
  "type": "string",
  "time": 1,
  "marks": 1,
  "params": {
    "board": "string",
    "grade": 2,
    "subject": "string"
  },
  "tags": [
    "string"
  ],
  "chapters": [
    "string"
  ],
  "sections": [
    {
      "marks_per_question": 1,
      "type": "string",
      "questions": [
        {
          "question": "string",
          "answer": "string",
          "type": "string",
          "question_slug": "string",
          "reference_id": "string",
          "hint": "string",
          "params": {
            "additionalProp1": "string",
            "additionalProp2": "string",
            "additionalProp3": "string"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}

No matter what do not break the structure of the provided JSON schema, if some information is missing in the user text keep that value as an empty string or null in the output JSON Schema.

For your reference, I am providing an USER_TEXT and an example OUTPUT below:

USER_TEXT: The title of the paper is Mathematics, the duration of the exam is 120 minutes, the exam is of 100 marks. This is a CBSE board exam for class 10th students. The question I am asking from Quadratic equation and it is of 5 marks, the question is: 'Solve the quadratic equation: x^2 + 5x + 6 = 0', and the answer is 'The Solutions are x = -2 and x = -3". To help the students I am also providing a hint: 'Use the quadratic formula or factorization method'.

OUTPUT:
